Okay, I need to solve this problem where for each element in the array, I have to find out how many other elements are smaller than it. Hmm, the straightforward approach would be O(n^2) because for each
element, you compare it with all others. But since that's not efficient enough, especially for larger arrays, I need a better way.

Wait, so let me think about what an efficient algorithm can do here. Oh right! Sorting the array might help because once sorted, we can use binary search to find how many elements are smaller than each
element.

But wait, there's a catch because when the same number appears multiple times, I don't want to count all of them as distinct since they're not unique in their position. So maybe if I sort and also track
duplicates or something?

Let me outline the steps:

1. Sort a copy of the original array.
2. For each element in the original array, find the first occurrence where the value is greater than it in the sorted array. The index at that point gives the count of elements smaller than the current
one.

But wait, since multiple duplicates can exist, I need to make sure not to include all instances. So for example, if the array is [2, 1, 2], when sorted becomes [1,2,2]. For each element:

- First 2: count is 1 (only 1)
- Second 1: no elements smaller
- Third 2: again only 1.

So using binary search for each element should work because it will find the position where current element would fit in the sorted array, and all elements before that are smaller. But since there could
be duplicates, maybe we need to adjust based on how many times the current value appears.

Wait, no. Because when you sort, for a given number x, if there are k occurrences of x, then any x in the original array should count all the numbers strictly less than x, which is the same as before
duplication. So binary search gives the correct lower bound.

So the plan is:

- Create a sorted version of the array.
- For each element in nums:
   - Use binary search to find the first index where the value is greater than current element.
   - The count is that index (since all elements before are less).
   - But need to handle duplicates properly. Wait, no—binary search gives the insertion point, which is equal to the number of elements strictly smaller.

So for example, in sorted array [1,2,2,3], if current element is 2:

- Binary search returns index 1 because it's the first occurrence where value is >=2. So wait, no: binary search might return different results depending on how it's implemented.

Wait, perhaps I should think about using a modified approach. For each number in nums[i], the count is equal to the number of elements strictly less than it in the entire array except itself.

So, for each x = nums[i], find the total number of elements in nums that are <x, and subtract 1 if there's another element equal to x elsewhere.

Wait no. Because when you have multiple occurrences of x, each x contributes to the count based on how many other smaller numbers exist.

For example, let’s take [8,1,2,2,3]. The sorted array is [1,2,2,3,8].

For 8: all elements except itself are less than it. So in the sorted array, find where 8 would be inserted, which is at index 4 (assuming zero-based). But since there's an element equal to 8? No, because
in this case, 8 appears only once. So the count is 4.

Wait, but wait: for 3, which is followed by 8. The sorted array has [1,2,2,3]. So for 3, all elements before it (three) are less. So the count is 3.

So maybe the approach is:

- Sort a copy of nums.
- For each x in nums:
   - Use binary search to find the first index where value >=x. The number of elements less than x is that index.
   - However, if there are duplicates of x (i.e., more than one occurrence), then subtracting 1 because we don't want to count x itself.

Wait no, for example, in [7,7,7,7], sorted is same. For each 7, the number of elements less than it is zero, which is correct as per Example3.

So the steps:

For a given x in nums:

1. In the sorted array, find how many elements are strictly less than x.
2. Subtract the number of times x appears before (but wait, no, because if x occurs multiple times, their indices may be different).

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me take Example 1: [8,1,2,2,3] sorted is [1,2,2,3,8].

For each element in nums:

- For 8: find the first index where value >=8. Since 8 is present at position4, and all before are less. So count is 4.
- For 1: in sorted array, find first index >=1 is 0, but since it's the same as x=1, we have to subtract the number of elements equal to x (since they can't be counted). Wait, no. Because for x=1, all
other elements are greater than or equal. So the count should be zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to find in the sorted array how many numbers are strictly less than x. Then, that's the count, because each of those is a valid j where nums[j] < nums[i].

So for 8: 4 elements (1,2,2,3) are less than it.

For 1: no elements are less than it.

For 2: in sorted array, all before the first occurrence of 2 are less. The index is 1, but since 2 occurs at position1 and beyond, how does that affect? Wait, wait—binary search for 2 would return index
1 because that's where the first 2 is.

Wait, let me clarify: if I use Binary Search to find the leftmost occurrence of x in the sorted array. Then, the number of elements less than x is equal to the insertion point of x (the position where it
would be inserted to keep the order). Because any element before that index is strictly less than x.

Wait, no—binary search for x returns the first occurrence of x if duplicates exist. But maybe I should use the lower_bound function, which gives the first element not smaller than x. So for each x in
nums[i], the number of elements less than it is equal to the position returned by lower_bound minus 1? No, wait.

Wait, let me think about how lower_bound works. Lower_bound returns the first element that is greater than or equal to the target. So for a given x, the number of elements less than x is the index where
lower_bound would return.

For example:

In sorted array [1,2,2,3,8], lower_bound for 2 is at position1.

So the count is 1 (elements before it are 1), which is correct for nums[0]=8: because lower_bound of 8 returns index4, so count is4.

Wait no. Wait when x=2, the lower_bound in the sorted array returns index1. So the number of elements less than x=2 is1 (only 1). But if I have another element at position2 which is also 2, then their
counts would be same? Because each occurrence of 2 can see that there's only one element less than it.

So perhaps for each element in nums, regardless of duplicates, the lower_bound function gives the correct count of elements less than x in the entire array.

Wait let me test this logic with Example3: [7,7,7,7].

Lower_bound for 7 returns index0. So count is 0, which is correct.

Another example: nums = [6,5,4,8], sorted as [4,5,6,8]. For each element:

- 6: lower_bound finds it at index2. So the number of elements less than 6 is 2 (4 and5). But in output, for 6 it's 2, correct.

Yes.

So, the plan is:

1. Sort a copy of nums into sorted_nums.
2. For each element x in the original array:
   a. Find the position where lower_bound would return for x in sorted_nums.
   b. The count is this position (since elements before are less than x).
3. But wait, if x appears multiple times, then the first occurrence's position would already include all duplicates.

Wait no. Let me take nums = [2,1,2,2].

sorted_nums is [1,2,2,2].

For each element:

- 2 (first one): lower_bound returns index1. So count is1.
- 1: returns index0. Count is0.
- Each subsequent 2: lower_bound returns index1. So their counts are all1.

Wait but in the original array:

- The first 2 has two elements after it that are 2, so how many j's have nums[j] < nums[i] (i=0)?

Looking at nums[0]=2: elements at positions1 and3. Wait no—nums[1] is1, which is less than 2; but the other elements in position2 and3 are 2, equal.

Wait wait: for i=0, x=2:

- Elements j where nums[j]<x? So any element <2: only nums[1]=1. So count should be1.

Which matches the lower_bound approach, which returns index1 (the first occurrence of 2) as the count is1.

Similarly, for the second 2 in the original array, at position2: when we search sorted_nums, lower_bound(2) is still index1. Count is1.

But wait in that case, if x occurs multiple times, but only once in the first occurrence, then all occurrences of x in the original array would have same count.

Wait in Example1:

nums = [8,1,2,2,3]

sorted_nums = [1,2,2,3,8].

For each 2 in nums[2], 2's lower_bound returns index1. So count is1.

Which is correct because only 1 is less than 2.

Similarly, for the last element 3: lower_bound(3) is at index3, so count is3 (elements 1,2,2). Which is correct as in Example1, it's 3 elements less than 3.

So seems like this approach works.

Therefore, steps are:

- Make a copy of nums and sort it into sorted_nums.
- For each x in nums:
   - Use lower_bound to find the first occurrence of x in sorted_nums.
   - The count is the position where x is found (since all before are <x).
- Return counts as list.

Now, implementing this in Python:

But wait, in Python, how does lower_bound work? Because the bisect module has bisect_left which returns insertion point. So if I have sorted_nums and x, bisect_left gives me i where sorted_nums[i] is
first >=x.

Yes. So for each x, using bisect.bisect_left on sorted_nums with x as argument will give us that count.

But wait: in Example1, for 2, the lower_bound returns index1 which is correct.

In code:

import bisect

nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
count_list = []
for x in nums:
    pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_nums, x)
    count_list.append(pos)

Then, for each element in count_list:

For 8: pos is4.
For 1: pos is0.
For 2: pos is1.
For another 2: pos is1.
For3:pos is3.

Which gives [4,0,1,1,3], which is the correct counts.

Yes.

So code would be:

import bisect

nums = list of input numbers
sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
result = []
for num in nums:
    pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_nums, num)
    result.append(pos)

Then return result.

Thus, this should solve the problem.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many elements are less than each element in a given list. This can be efficiently achieved using sorting and binary search techniques.

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Sort the List**: First, sort a copy of the input list. Sorting helps us efficiently find the position where each element would fit using binary search.
2. **Binary Search (Lower Bound)**: For each element in the original list, use binary search to determine its lower bound in the sorted list. The position returned by the lower bound function gives the
count of elements less than the current element.
3. **Construct Result List**: Store these counts in a result list and return it as the final output.

This approach leverages sorting to enable efficient range queries using binary search, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n).

### Solution Code
```python
import bisect

def count_less_elements(nums):
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_nums, num)
        result.append(pos)
    return result
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: The input list is sorted to create a new list where each element's position can be efficiently determined using binary search.
2. **Binary Search (Lower Bound)**: Using the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module, we find the position where each element would be inserted in the sorted list. This position indicates how
many elements are less than the current element.
3. **Result Construction**: For each element in the original list, we calculate its count of preceding smaller elements and store these counts in the result list.

This method ensures that we efficiently count the number of elements less than each element in O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting and binary search operations.
